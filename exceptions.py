Problem Statement
Exceptions
Errors detected during execution are called exceptions.
Examples:
ZeroDivisionError 
Raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero.
>>> a = '1'
>>> b = '0'
>>> print int(a) / int(b)
>>> ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
ValueError 
Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value.
>>> a = '1'
>>> b = '#'
>>> print int(a) / int(b)
>>> ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '#'

Handling Exceptions
try and except statements can be used to handle selected exceptions. A try statement may have more than one except clause, to specify handlers for different exceptions.
#Code
try:
    print 1/0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
print "Error Code:",e
#Output
Error Code: integer division or modulo by zero
Task
You are given two values a and b. 
Your task is to do integer division and print a/b.
Input Format
First line contains, number of testcases T. 
Next T line contains, space separated values of a and b.
Constraints
0<T<10
Output Format
Print value of a/b. 
In case of ZeroDivisionError or ValueError, print the error code.
Sample Input
3
1 0
2 $
3 1
Sample Output
Error Code: integer division or modulo by zero
Error Code: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '$'
3
Note: 
For integer division in Python 3 use //.
